                <p>Well if I tell you the truth, C++ is a very difficult programming language to implement But easy to learn & understand, And i'm trying to build a game using this programming language as it Supports Object Oriented Approach and Simplifies the WorkLoad and Lines of Codes. Using Object Oriented Software Engineering, It will be a little bit easier to implement.</p>
